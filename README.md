This app is used to predict the heart state of an individual the disease sections include ->

**1. Presence of the heart disease**

**2. Patient is healthy**

## Structure Of The Project
- Each prediction page is conneceted with a Machine Learning Model which uses Logistic Regression to predict the results.
- Also we have used datasets Heart_disease.csv used for each prediction.
- We can land into each prediction site of the web app from the options in the Navigation Menu.


- Each prediction is done with the help of many features which will be taken as input from the user.
- The most relevant features are taken into consideration for prediction also these features can be found out with simple tests or analysis without visiting any doctor.
- So the victim can get a broad overview of their health condition.

The feature selection is carefully done under the supervision of a medical science student.

## Deployment Of The Project

After the modeling part the model is deployed using Streamlit library on Streamlit Share so that the app is available for usage for everyone.
